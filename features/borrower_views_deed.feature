Feature: Borrower Views the Deed
  As a Borrower
  I want to search for my mortgage document
  So that I can view it

  Background:
    Given I have created a deed with two borrowers


      Scenario: Borrower enters a valid deed reference

            Deed must display:
             - Borrowers
             - Title number

      Given I navigate to the borrower frontend "/searchdeed" page
      When I search for the created deed
      Then the â€œYour mortgage deed" page is displayed

  Scenario: Borrower enters invalid deed reference

      - information message displayed when incorrect id entered

      Given I navigate to the borrower frontend "/searchdeed" page
      When I search for an invalid deed
      Then the "Deed was not found for:" page is displayed
